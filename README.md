# Github tutorial 

Just learnt how branches, commiting and pull requests work on github

branches are just a copy of the main branch in this scenario, has all the same files as the branch that your branched off lmao.

when you make changes to a file in a branch and commit it, The updates on the file is committed on the branch you were working on meaning the branch you decide to work on the file on.

Pull requests is a temporary request for people to pull contributions into the branch they are working on (can be any branch) from team members or contributors!
